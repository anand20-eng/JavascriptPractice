1) what is feature of react js

1) JSX
2) Component
3) virtual DOM
4) One-way-data-binding
5) HighPerformance.


1) JSX --

- jsx is syntax extension to javascript
- By using JSX, we can write HTML sturctues in same file that
2) Component

- Component are the building bloks of any React application, and single app usually consits of mulitple
component...
-  a singal app usually consists of multiple components
- it splists the user interface into independent,
 reusable parts that can be processed separetly....

3) Virtual DOM : -  React keeps a lightweight representaion
of the real DOM in the memory that is known as th virtual DOM

when the state the state of an object changes, virutal DOM 
change only that object in the real DOM rather thane updaitng all the object

4) One-way-data-binding
- React's one-way data binding keeps everything modular and fast. A unidirectional data flow means...that when desinging
a React app, you often nest a child component within parent
components..........

you often nest child component with parent


5) High performance: 

React updates only those componets that have changes,
rahter than updating all components at once.this restul in much faster web application
