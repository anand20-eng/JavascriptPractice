2) what is arrow function ?

Arrow function allow us to write shorter function syntax

3) what about this funciton 

--- The handling of this is also different in arrow funciton compared to
regular funciton 

In short with arrow function there is no bindig of this 

4) what is useContext ?

 - React Context is a way to manage state globally 
 - It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between
    deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone

-   To do this without contex, we will need to pass the state as 
  props through each nested component This is called 'prop drilling'
